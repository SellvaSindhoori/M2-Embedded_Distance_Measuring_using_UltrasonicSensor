# Requirements

Fire Alarm Circuit is a simple circuit that detects the fire and activates the Siren Sound orBuzzer. Fire Alarm Circuits are very important devices to detect fire in the right time and prevent any damage to people or property.Fire Alarm Circuits and Smoke Sensors are a part of the security systems which help indetecting or preventing damage. Installing Fire Alarm Systems and Smoke Sensors incommercial buildings like offices, movie theatres, shopping malls and other public places iscompulsory

## Introduction
A fire alarm system has a number of devices working together to detect and warn peoplethrough visual and audio appliances when smoke, fire, carbon monoxideorother  emergenciesare present. These alarms may be activated automatically from smokedetectors, and  heat detectorsor may also be activated via manual fire alarm activationdevicessuch as manual call points or pull stations.Alarms can be either motorized bells or wall mountable sounders or horns. They can also be speaker strobeswhich sound an alarm, followed by a voice evacuation message which warns people inside the building not to use the elevators. Fire alarm sounders can be set to certainfrequencies and different tones including low, medium and high, depending on the country andmanufacturer of the device. Most fire alarm systems in Europesound like a siren withalternating frequencies.

## Research

There are many types of fire alarmsystems each suited to different building types and applications. A fire alarm system can varydramatically in both price and complexity, from a single panel with a detector and sounder ina small commercial property to an addressable fire alarm system in a multi-occupancy building.Magnetic smoke door holders/retainers: wall mounted solenoids or electromagnets controlled by a fire alarm system or detection component that magnetically secures spring-loaded self-closing smoke tight doors in the open position. Designed to de-magnetize to allow automaticclosure of the door on command from the fire control or upon failure of the power source,interconnection or controlling element

## Defining our System
A Resistance Thermometer or Resistance Temperature Detector is a device which used todetermine the temperature by measuring the resistance of pure electrical wire. This wire isreferred to as a temperature sensor. If we want to measure temperature with highaccuracy, RTD is the only one solution in industries. An RTD works by using a basic principle;as the temperature of a metal increases, so does the resistance to the flow of electricity. Anelectrical current is passed through the sensor, the resistance element is used to measurethe resistance of the current being passed through it.

This whole Electronics Store billing system project is developed using C Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it. Electronics Store Billing System in C Programming is free to download with source code.
## SWOT Analysis

## 4W's and 1'H
### Why:
The main concept of building this project is to easily keep the building security alert in case fire out situations.
### What:
This project is all about the alert system towards the fire emission in case of emergency.
### Where:
This project is to be implemented on various buildings for security purposes in case of fire out emergencies.
### When:
This project is going to be deployed on 2/12/2021.
### How:
This project is going to be based on the alarm system that works on the emission of the fire and sets an evacuation purpose immediately for safety concerns.
